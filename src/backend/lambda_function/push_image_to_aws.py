    Assume a temporary AWS IAM role for ECR access and set environment credentials.

    Uses AWS STS (Security Token Service) to assume a temporary role with limited
    permissions instead of using long-term access keys. This follows AWS security
    best practices and provides time-limited access to resources.

    Role Requirements:
        - ECRAccessRole must exist in the target AWS account
        - Role should have the minimum required permissions for ECR operations
        - ECRUser profile must have sts:AssumeRole permission for ECRAccessRole

    Notes:
        - Credentials are temporary and will expire after 1 hour
        - The ECRUser profile should be configured in ~/.aws/credentials or ~/.aws/config
        - Role session name 'ecrSession' is used for AWS CloudTrail logging
